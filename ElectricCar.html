            <p style="line-height: 3em">With climate change effects at all high time automobile companies are changing they way there doing things. Day by day car companies are switching from gasoline driven cars to electric.


                The demand for electric cars has grown exponentially since 2005 when there were less than a thousand electric cars on roads to over a million by 2017.
                
                
                We as a Society have recognized that climate change is real and by releasing emission to the atmosphere what were causing is detrimental to human health.
                
                Electric cars provide a better solution for the environment and itâ€™s a better option when purchasing a vehicle.
                
                
                Electric cars are simpler to maintain most new cars come with internal combustion engines with long maintenance check which includes an oil, transmission, brake fluid change etc. All of which adds up.
                While electric cars come with fewer maintenance requirements therefore the costs are lower    
                
                Lastly, electric cars are safer the reason is for instance if a regular car were to be in accident there is chance for the car to explode on a electric car its virtually impossible for the car to explode because heavy batteries packs significantly lower and electric cars center of mass is less likely to rollover.
